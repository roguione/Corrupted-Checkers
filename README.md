Project 1
Browser-based Game
Overview
Your first SEI project will start out with something fun - a game!

Thanks to the amount of logic there is in a game, there's no better app than a game to teach you how to think like a programmer!

Everyone will get a chance to be creative, and work through some really tough programming challenges. You got your feet wet with our game code-alongs during class - now it's time to pick a game and go for it.

You will be working individually for this project. However, your instructors and instructor assistants will be available for support via the support channel in Slack. Please be sure to provide the details of the issue you are having - screenshots and relevant code are very helpful.

As a reminder, GA has a zero plagiarism policy - your project's code must be substantially yours. Do not copy code from similar projects, tutorials, or other sources. However, using lines of code from StackOverflow to accomplish general techniques/algorithms is okay - an example would be using StackOverflow as a source for code that replaces a character at a certain position in a string.

Lastly, in addition to presenting your projects, you will be required to complete a Project 1 Assessment (more in a bit).

Planning & Presentation Requirements
Planning:
To more easily share your work with future employers, you will want to create your project in Github.com. This new Github (not GH Enterprise) repository will include your project files, a README.md, and planning materials that will be included in a planning.md file.

Your planning.md file will share:

☐ Your choice of game.

☐ A wireframe of your "main" game screen.

☐ Pseudocode for the overall game play.

Presentation:
You will have a maximum of 7 minutes to present your project following these guidelines:

**Introduce the Project: **

☐ Intro your game by paraphrasing the README.

Demonstrate the Project:

☐ Launch the game by clicking the link in the README.

☐ Play the game! If necessary, manipulate the values of variables in the console to ensure a quick win or loss.

Show/discuss your code:

☐ Briefly show the HTML & CSS.

☐ Show the JavaScript and discuss your favorite function.

Share the experience:

☐ What was your biggest challenge?

☐ What are your key learnings/takeaways?

Q & A + Feedback

Technical Requirements
Your App Must:
☐ Render a game in the browser.

☐ Include win/loss logic and render win/loss messages in HTML. Popup alerts using the alert() method are okay during development, but not production.

☐ Include separate HTML, CSS & JavaScript files.

☐ Use vanilla JavaScript, not 3rd party JS libraries.

☐ Have properly indented HTML, CSS & JavaScript. In addition, vertical whitespace needs to be consistent. Hint: download the VSCode Prettier extension for consistent formatting.

☐ No remaining unused and/or commented out code (code that will never be called). Keep unused code in a scratch.js in a lib subdirectory.

☐ Have functions and variables that are named sensibly. Remember, functions are typically named as verbs and variables (data) named as nouns.

☐ Be coded in a consistent manner. For example, choose between your preference for function declarations vs. function expressions.

☐ Be deployed online using GitHub Pages so that the rest of the world can play your game!

Necessary Deliverables
☐ The code for a working game that meets or exceeds the above technical requirements, built by you, and hosted on GitHub Pages (covered next week).

A README.md file with these sections:

☐ <Your game's title>: A description of your game. Background info of the game is a nice touch.

☐ Screenshot(s): Images of your actual game.

Note: if you edit your README.md on the github website editor, you can copy and paste image files directly to your markdown.

☐ Technologies Used: List of the technologies used, e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS...

☐ Getting Started: In this section include the link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important.

☐ Next Steps: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).

Note: Don't underestimate the value of a well crafted README.md. The README.md introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!

☐ Frequent commits (at least 1 every day) dating back to the very beginning of the project. Never delete you repo to "start over".

Commit messages should be in the present tense, e.g., "Style game board" instead of "Styled game board".

Be sure to create the repo on your personal GitHub account and ensure that it is "public".

Choose From the Following Games
Note: Games are listed in approximate order of increasing difficulty.

Trivia Game
A user will click through dynamically pouplated questions.
Stretch Goal - included a timer or correct question 'streaks' calculated for bonus points.
Spaceman
A good icebox feature (optional feature) is to allow the player to choose from categories of words.
Concentration (Memory Game)
Use "cards" or other theme
Will need to display "wrong" guess until a timer expires or until the next click.
Must lose after a certain amount of time or after X number of bad guesses.
Slot Machine
Stretch Goals - includes a wagering feature
Blackjack
Do not have to implement splitting hands
(Stretch Goal) - implement wagering feature
Simon
Stretch Goals - includes audio or animations
War - Must include recursive 'War' turn
Mastermind (Guess the Code)
Minesweeper
Must implement "flood" feature
Checkers
No AI required - player vs. player is fine
Mancala
Implementing "capturing" is not required
Roulette
Must implement wagering feature
Video Poker
Must implement wagering feature
Craps
Must implement wagering feature
Solitaire
Battleship
Requires some AI to implement the computer opponent
Only the above games are approved. Any other choices, which is extremely discouraged, must receive approval from your instructor before starting your planning (wireframes & pseudocode)!

IMPORTANT: Because it's important to demonstrate your ability to perform DOM manipulation using JavaScript, all games should be DOM-based, not canvas-based.

Suggestions
The BEST advice is to follow the guidelines and principles in the Guide to Building a Browser App. The guide will give you a step-by-step process to get you started and its MVC design pattern will result in clearer, more concise code that can scale functionality more easily.
Theme your game to give it a more personal touch and make it more unique!
Use your Development Tools (Chrome DevTools rock!) to debug and solve issues.
Keep it simple. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) functionality that looks great is better than extra functionality added to a game without polish.
If you choose a card-based game, there is a CSS library in the resources directory of the class repo that will help you render beautiful cards of any size, front and back.
Review and check regularly the Project 1 Code Review to ensure that your project is going to meet the minimum requirements.
Consult documentation and other resources to better understand methods, etc.
Write DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code. Check for repeating code and refactor into functions that accept arguments.
