# Corrupted Checkers BBG

## About
Checkers is one of the oldest games we know. The earliest board found dates back to 3,000 BCE, making it around 5,000 years old! The fact that people still play checkers is a testament to just how addictive, enjoyable, and easy the game is to learn and play. In this game of checkers the rules are same. I have only changed the styling around

## Rules/Instructions  

- Deciding who goes first can vary from version to version. Unlike Chess, white doesn't have to go first -- it can be whoever you want. In our version of Checkers, you'll always go first when playing against the computer.

### Simply beat the other opponent by capturing all their pieces

-  Each player has 12 checkers divided between three rows 
  
-  To set the game up, Each player places their checkers on the black squares in the first three rows in   front of them
  
-  Checkers can only move diagonally, and they can only move forward. You can move one checker per turn. To capture the opposing player's piece, you have to jump over the said piece with one of your checkers

- Capture opponents pieces by jumping them
  
- Pieces can move forward or diagonally unless Kinged
  - If one of your pieces makes it to the other side of the board that piece becomes a king

- The king can move forward and backward diagonally on the board. This is a huge advantage, and players should try as hard as they can to crown their pieces
  
## How To Win Checkers

- One of the most popular strategies is controlling the center. Your pieces are safer at the edges of the board since they can't be captured there, but this also lowers your chances of making a capture

- You should always focus on getting at least one piece to become a king. The opponent's side of the board is a good place to be and opens up a lot of great move opportunities. Jump pieces when you can, but always have a piece going up the board to become king

- Try moving your checkers in groups of two or three to best protect them. A checker backed up by two other checkers behind it diagonally can't be captured

- Like Chess, sometimes you need to sacrifice a checker for the greater good of the game. Don't be afraid to sacrifice a piece or two if it sets your opponent up for a more devastating loss

- Overall, you need to pay close attention to win at Checkers. Watch for any multi-jumps, pay close attention to your player's kings, and never leave yourself open to captures unless it will result in your opponent losing at least one piece down the road
