# Corrupted Checkers BBG

## About
Checkers is one of the oldest games we know. The earliest board found dates back to 3,000 BCE, making it around 5,000 years old! The fact that people still play checkers is a testament to just how addictive, enjoyable, and easy the game is to learn and play. In this game of checkers the rules are same. I have only changed the styling around

## Rules/Instructions  

- Deciding who goes first can vary from version to version. Unlike Chess, white doesn't have to go first -- it can be whoever you want. In our version of Checkers, you'll always go first when playing against the computer.

### Simply beat the other opponent by capturing all their pieces

-  Each player has 12 checkers divided between three rows 
  
-  To set the game up, Each player places their checkers on the black squares in the first three rows in   front of them
  
-  Checkers can only move diagonally, and they can only move forward. You can move one checker per turn. To capture the opposing player's piece, you have to jump over the said piece with one of your checkers

- Capture opponents pieces by jumping them
  
- Pieces can move forward or diagonally unless Kinged
  - If one of your pieces makes it to the other side of the board that piece becomes a king to win
  
## How To Win Corrupted Checkers BBG

- #### Simply be the First one to make it to other side of board and get kinged wins
- #### OG OOOG can be tricky and will take your checkers, blocking is best best strategy
- #### A crucial point to note is that the game's computer AI is very basic. It doesn't optimize its moves;instead, it chooses one randomly from the available valid moves.
